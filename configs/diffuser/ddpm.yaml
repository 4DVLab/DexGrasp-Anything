  use_dpmsolver: ${use_dpmsolver} # Whether to use dpmsolver++ for sampling
  name: 'dpmsolver++' # Specifies dpmsolver++ as the sampling algorithm
  steps: 10 # The total number of function evaluations (NFE), i.e., the number of time steps in the sampling process
  order: 1 # The order of the sampling algorithm, 1 refers to DDIM, 2 means dpmsolver++ uses second-order samplingï¼Œ3 means dpmsolver++ uses third-order sampling
  skip_type: 'time_uniform' # The type for the spacing of the time steps. 'time_uniform' or 'logSNR' or 'time_quadratic'.
  t_start: 1  # dpmsolver++ only supports inputs in continuous time, this sets the starting time for sampling at t = 1
  t_end: 0.01  # The end time for sampling, near 0, representing the terminal state of the diffusion process
  method: 'singlestep'    #The method for sampling. 'singlestep' or 'multistep' or 'singlestep_fixed' or 'adaptive'.
